# Vehicle Logo Detection and Recognition

## Overview
This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting and recognizing vehicle logos. It's implemented in Python using the PySide6 framework for the GUI, OpenCV for image processing, and PyTorch for the YOLO model.

## Features
- **Image Import:** Allows users to import vehicle images.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Detects and recognizes vehicle logos using the YOLO model.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Built with PySide6 for easy interaction.
- **Model Training:** Custom training of the YOLO model on vehicle logos dataset.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python
- PySide6
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO


## Usage
1. **Import Image:** Click the 'Importer' button to import a vehicle image.
2. **Predict:** Click the 'Predict' button to detect and recognize the vehicle logo.
3. **View Results:** The detected logo will be displayed in the application.

## Model Training
- Train the YOLO model using the `model.py` method.
- The training dataset and epochs can be customized.
- Save the trained model for future predictions.


## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Ultralytics team for the YOLO model and contributors to the PyTorch, OpenCV, and PySide6 libraries.
